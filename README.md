## Description

This is the byproduct of the Softtek evaluation in regarding to the .Net academy, in which we learnt about how to create a backend API based in .Net Core, with some basic and not so basic functionalities, such as JWT Authentication and Authorization, Unit Testing ( at least the basics of it ) with MS Testing, Login features with implementation of the named JWT Token, swagger documentation as well as POSTMAN Documentation, how to create and consume API endpoints as well as their HTTP status codes, as well as some frontend qualities, which is what im about to show you with this MVC application.

Everything was made taking in consideration the good practices we learnt by reading the UMSA-SOFTTEK PDF documents and throughout the academy.




## **Arquitecture Specifications**
â€‹
### **Controller Layer**
In this controller layer, we will have 6 different controllers, which will be in charge of managing the logic of the application, as well as the incoming and outcoming DTOs,
and creating the objects so they can be displayed in the Views.

â€‹
### **Views Layer**
In this layer we will have all of the views of the application, that are linked to their controllers per se, while also hacing
partial views that will work and serve as forms and as information loggers.

â€‹
### **Data Layer**
In this project, we will basically have the core of the application. This is where we will have all of the models that we will
display on the different views of the program, they will be called into the controller so the controller can fill them up
with data or instantiate them so we can use them as we please.
